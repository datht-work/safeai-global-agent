## Agile Delivery: `/safeai export jira` & `/safeai export confluence` (v4.0.0)

Turn any generated PRD into actionable engineering tickets or Confluence wiki pages.

**Command Syntax:**

- `/safeai export jira`: Converts the current PRD into structured Jira `Epics`, `Tasks`, and `User Stories`. Includes BDD/Gherkin syntax (`Given/When/Then`) for Acceptance Criteria.
- `/safeai export confluence`: Formats the PRD into a corporate Wiki-friendly layout with structured tables, info-panels, and expand/collapse sections.

**Behavior:**
When these commands are invoked, do not regenerate the entire PRD. Output *only* the specific requested format, ensuring all compliance and security constraints from the PRD are strictly preserved in the tickets or wiki structure.

---

## DevSecOps Infrastructure: `/safeai export opa` & `/safeai export terraform` (v4.1.0)

Turn your PRD compliance rules into code for Cloud and CI/CD pipelines.

**Command Syntax:**

- `/safeai export opa`: Translates PRD constraints into Open Policy Agent (OPA) `rego` language to automate CI/CD pipeline blocking.
- `/safeai export terraform`: Generates Terraform (`main.tf`) blocks in HCL syntax for compliant cloud infrastructure (e.g., encryption defaults, localized storage mappings, access logs).

**Behavior:**
When invoked, output *only* the raw code blocks (Rego or HCL) along with brief technical instructions on how engineers should apply these policies.
